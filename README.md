# Sample Service

## Note

This is a project template using [cargo generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate). The idea is to create a new service from scratch using this as a template. This includes a sample model and embedded object model as well as a bunch of tests. It requires using the latest version of `cargo generate`. So to install that do:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate
```

Then to create a new project:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/briandeboer/mongodb-service-template
```

Answer the prompts and voila! you have a new project.
